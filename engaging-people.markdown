Engagement is building relationships and putting those relationships to work to accomplish shared goals.

Engagement isn’t just about clicking links or _liking_ something on Facebook. It’s a deepening of relationships that builds partnerships and collaboration as a means of creating economic and societal value.

Companies that know how to deeply engage employees, partners, customers and other key stakeholders in their work have an insurmountable advantage over other firms.

These companies are powered by the greatest force on the planet: _the human soul_.

Engagement is what brings tasks and relationships together. Engagement is the process of building relationships with people and putting those relationships to work to accomplish some goal.

First-order engagement is engaging employees. Second-order engagement is engaging customers and partners. Third-order engagement is when customers and partners engage other customers and partners in the organization’s work.

A connection, or point of contact, in a relationship is a very ancient tool that biological life of all types uses to stay connected with its surrounding environment in a productive and safe way.

### [<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-423" title="Connection with Action" src="http://www.alchemyofchange.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Connection-with-Action.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80" />](http://www.alchemyofchange.net/how-connections-wrap-our-engagement/)<a title="Permalink to How Connections “Wrap” Our Engagement" href="http://www.alchemyofchange.net/how-connections-wrap-our-engagement/" rel="bookmark">How Connections “Wrap” Our Engagement</a>

You can think of connections as analogous to the packaging that wraps a product you buy at the store. The underlying “product” is the activity, or work, you want to coordinate with someone; the packaging is the connection between you.

I love it when a scientist comes along and proves something that, on an intuitive level, I just knew had to be true. That’s what just happened for me while watching Martin Nowark talk about his work on cooperation…. Just as I suspected: cooperation isn’t all fluffy white bunnies.
