My name is Gideon Rosenblatt. Thanks for interrupting your tweeting to stop by. My writings here on Alchemy of Change cover a range of topics, but pivot on a central theme, which is **keeping humanity burning bright in the organizations, technologies and other stuff we build**.

I write mostly about the impact that technology has on people, organizations and society. Here’s a quick overview of [what I cover on Alchemy of Change](http://www.alchemyofchange.net/about/about-alchemy-of-change/ "Alchemy of Change").

I’m a technologist with a background in business _and_ social change. I worked at Microsoft for nearly ten years in marketing and building building some pretty cool stuff. I then ran a mission-driven technology consulting group, called Groundwire. Now I write. Want more detail? Here’s [my full story](http://www.alchemyofchange.net/about/about-gideon-rosenblatt/ "Gideon Rosenblatt").

As a fellow Twitter user, here are two articles you might like:

*[Twitter is Not a Social Network](http://www.alchemyofchange.net/twitter-is-not-a-social-network/) has some great stats on how people actually use Twitter and some conclusions about what the network really is – and is not.

*[Twitter’s Golden Egg](http://www.alchemyofchange.net/twitters-golden-egg/) is about people like you – “Information Networkers” who are the true engine of Twitter’s “real-time information network.”

Thanks again for stopping by and happy Tweeting!
